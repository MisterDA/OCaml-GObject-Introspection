(** GITypeInfo â€” Struct representing a type *)

open Ctypes

(** GITypeInfo represents a type. You can retrieve a type info from an argument
    (see GIArgInfo), a function return value (see GIFunctionInfo), a field
    (see GIFieldInfo), a property (see GIPropertyInfo), a constant
    (see GIConstantInfo) or for a union discriminator (see GIUnionInfo).
    A type can either be a of a basic type which is a standard C primitive type
    or an interface type. For interface types you need to call
    GITypeInfo.get_interface to get a reference to the base info for that
    interface. *)
