(** GIFieldInfo â€” Module representing a struct or union field. *)

(** A GIFieldInfo struct represents a field of a struct (see GIStructInfo),
    union (see GIUnionInfo) or an object (see GIObjectInfo).
    The GIFieldInfo is fetched by calling
    GIStructInfo.get_field,
    GIUnionInfo.get_field
    or GIObjectInfo.get_field. A field has a size, type and a struct offset
    asssociated and a set of flags, which is currently
    GI_FIELD_IS_READABLE or GI_FIELD_IS_WRITABLE.*)
type fieldinfo

(** Flags for a GIFieldInfo. *)
type flags =
  | Is_readable (** field is readable. *)
  | Is_writable (** field is writable. *)

external get_flags:
  fieldinfo -> flags = "caml_g_ifieldinfo_get_flags_c"
