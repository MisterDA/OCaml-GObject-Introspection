(** GIFieldInfo â€” Module representing a struct or union field. *)

(** A GIFieldInfo struct represents a field of a struct (see GIStructInfo),
    union (see GIUnionInfo) or an object (see GIObjectInfo).
    The GIFieldInfo is fetched by calling
    GIStructInfo.get_field,
    GIUnionInfo.get_field
    or GIObjectInfo.get_field. A field has a size, type and a struct offset
    asssociated and a set of flags, which is currently
    GI_FIELD_IS_READABLE or GI_FIELD_IS_WRITABLE.*)
type fieldinfo

(** Flags for a GIFieldInfo. *)
type flags =
  | Is_readable (** field is readable. *)
  | Is_writable (** field is writable. *)

(** Obtain the flags for this GIFieldInfo. See GIFieldInfo.flags for possible
    flag values. *)
external get_flags:
  fieldinfo -> flags = "caml_g_field_info_get_flags_c"

(** Obtain the offset in bits of the field member, this is relative to the
    beginning of the struct or union.*)
external get_offset:
  fieldinfo -> int = "caml_g_field_info_get_offset_c"
