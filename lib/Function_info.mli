(** Function_info represents a function, method or constructor. To find out
    what kind of entity a Function_info represents, call
    Function_info.get_flags.

    other metadata. *)

    In order to avoid circular call graph between Function_info and GIVFuncInfo,
    this function will return a Callable_info. It is upto the user to use
    GIVFuncInfo.from_callableinfo in order to have the GIVFuncInfo.*)
