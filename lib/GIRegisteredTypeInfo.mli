(**  GIRegisteredTypeInfo â€” Struct representing a struct with a GType. *)

open Ctypes

(** GIRegisteredTypeInfo represents an entity with a GType associated. Could be
    either a GIEnumInfo, GIInterfaceInfo, GIObjectInfo, GIStructInfo or a
    GIUnionInfo.
    A registered type info struct has a name and a type function. To get the
    name call GIRegisteredTypeInfo.get_type_name. Most users want to call
    GIRegisteredTypeInfo.get_g_type and don't worry about the rest of the
    details. *)
