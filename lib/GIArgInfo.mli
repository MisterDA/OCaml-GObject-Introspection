    GICallableInfo. *)

(** The direction of a GIArgInfo. *)
type direction =
  | In    (** in argument. *)
  | Out   (** out argument. *)
  | InOut (** in and out argument. *)

(** Obtain the direction of the argument. Check GIDirection for possible
    direction values.*)
val get_direction:
  t structure ptr -> direction

(** Obtain the index of the user data argument. This is only valid for
    arguments which are callbacks. Returns index of the user data argument or
    -1 if there is none. *)
val get_closure:
  t structure ptr -> int

(** Obtains the index of the GDestroyNotify argument. This is only valid for
    arguments which are callbacks. Returns index of the GDestroyNotify argument
    or -1 if there is none *)
val get_destroy:
  t structure ptr -> int

(** The transfer is the exchange of data between two parts, from the callee to
    the caller. The callee is either a function/method/signal or an
    object/interface where a property is defined. The caller is the side
    accessing a property or calling a function. GITransfer specifies who's
    responsible for freeing the resources after the ownership transfer is
    complete. In case of a containing type such as a list, an array or a hash
    table the container itself is specified differently from the items within
    the container itself. Each container is freed differently, check the
    documentation for the types themselves for information on how to free them.*)
type transfer =
  | Nothing    (** transfer nothing from the callee (function or the type
                   instance the property belongs to) to the caller. The callee
                   retains the ownership of the transfer and the caller doesn't
                   need to do anything to free up the resources of this transfer. *)
  | Container  (** transfer the container (list, array, hash table) from the
                   callee to the caller. The callee retains the ownership of
                   the individual items in the container and the caller has to
                   free up the container resources (g_list_free()/
                   g_hash_table_destroy() etc) of this transfer. *)
  | Everything (** transfer everything, eg the container and its contents from
                   the callee to the caller. This is the case when the callee
                   creates a copy of all the data it returns. The caller is
                   responsible for cleaning up the container and item resources
                   of this transfer. *)

    of possible values. *)

(** Obtain if the type of the argument includes the possibility of NULL. For
    'in' values this means that NULL is a valid value. For 'out' values, this
    means that NULL may be returned. See also GIArgInfo.is_optional. *)
