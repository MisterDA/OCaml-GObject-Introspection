(** Signal_info â€” Struct representing a signal. *)

open Ctypes

(** Signal_info represents a signal. It's a sub-struct of Callable_info and
    contains a set of flags and a class closure.
    See Callable_info for information on how to retreive arguments and other
    metadata from the signal. *)
type t
val signalinfo : t structure typ

(** Obtain if the returning true in the signal handler will stop the emission
    of the signal. *)
val true_stops_emit:
  t structure ptr -> bool

(** The signal flags are used to specify a signal's behaviour, the overall
    signal description outlines how especially the RUN flags control the stages
    of a signal emission. *)
type flags =
  | Run_first     (** Invoke the object method handler in the first
                      emission stage. *)
  | Run_last      (** Invoke the object method handler in the third
                      emission stage. *)
  | Run_cleanup   (** Invoke the object method handler in the last
                      emission stage. *)
  | No_recurse    (** Signals being emitted for an object while currently
                      being in emission for this very object will not be
                      emitted recursively, but instead cause the first
                      emission to be restarted. *)
  | Detailed      (** This signal supports "::detail" appendices to the
                      signal name upon handler connections and emissions. *)
  | Action        (** Action signals are signals that may freely be
                      emitted on alive objects from user code via
                      g_signal_emit() and friends, without the need of
                      being embedded into extra code that performs pre or
                      post emission adjustments on the object. They can
                      also be thought of as object methods which can be
                      called generically by third-party code. *)
  | No_hooks      (** No emissions hooks are supported for this signal. *)
  | Must_collect  (** Varargs signal emission will always collect the
                      arguments, even if there are no signal handlers
                      connected. Since 2.30. *)
  | Deprecated    (** The signal is deprecated and will be removed in a
                      future version. A warning will be generated if it is
                      connected while running with G_ENABLE_DIAGNOSTIC=1.
                      Since 2.32. *)

(** Obtain the flags for this signal info. See GSignalFlags for more
    information about possible flag values. *)
val get_flags:

(** Obtain the class closure for this signal if one is set. The class closure
    is a virtual function on the type that the signal belongs to. If the signal
    lacks a closure None will be returned.
    In order to avoid circular call graph between Signal_info and VFunc_info,
    this function will return a Callable_info. It is upto the user to use
    GIVSignalInfo.from_callableinfo in order to have the VFunc_info.*)
