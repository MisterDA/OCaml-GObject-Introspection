(** Callable_info â€” Struct representing a callable. *)

open Ctypes

(** Callable_info represents an entity which is callable. Currently a function
    (Function_info), virtual function, (GIVFuncInfo) or callback
    (GICallbackInfo).
    A callable has a list of arguments (Arg_info), a return type, direction
    and a flag which decides if it returns null*)
type t
val callableinfo: t structure typ

(** Does the function throws an error. *)
val can_throw_gerror:
  t structure ptr -> bool

(** Obtain the number of arguments (both IN and OUT) for this callable. *)
val get_n_args:
  t structure ptr -> int

(** Retrieve an arbitrary attribute associated with the return value. *)
val get_return_attribute:
  t structure ptr -> string option

(** Determines if the callable info is a method. For GIVFuncInfos,
    GICallbackInfos, and Signal_infos, this is always true. Otherwise, this
    looks at the Function_info.Is_method flag on the Function_info.
    Concretely, this function returns whether Callable_info.get_n_args matches
    the number of arguments in the raw C method. For methods, there is one more
    C argument than is exposed by introspection: the "self" or "this" object. *)
